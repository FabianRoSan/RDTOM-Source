RDTOM-Source
============

The source code used by the Roller Derby Test O'Matic website.

The code was written originally by John Kershaw (a.k.a. Sausage Roller). To allow for better development as the project progressed, on 20th July 2012 the project was open sourced and uploaded to GitHub for all to see and use. You must ask for permission before using.

Use Git Clone to get a copy of the files on your server. Then use 

```
ln -s RDTOM-Source/app/ app
ln -s RDTOM-Source/html/ html
```

to create the alias directories.

Finally, create your config.ini, logs and filecache folders.

To get the latest you can now simply run a git pull.
