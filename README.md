RDTOM-Source
============

The source code used by the Roller Derby Test O'Matic website.

The code was written originally by John Kershaw (a.k.a. Sausage Roller). To allow for better development as the project progressed, on 20th July 2012 the project was open sourced and uploaded to GitHub for all to see and use.

Use Git Clone to get a copy of the files on your server. Then use 

ln -s RDTOM-Source/app/ app
ln -s RDTOM-Source/html/ html

to create the alias directories.

And finally create your config.ini
